# Speech-i-Py
Our final submissions for this hackathon are in the files recog_final.py and voiceDraft.py. Please ignore other files.

Speech-i-Py is one of the world's first speech-to-code products. Not only does Speech-i-Py make programming a convenience for us regular developers, but it also makes it an option for the 57 million people in the US inhibited from typing due to a physical challenge.

Our prototype uses PyPI's SpeechRecognition library for the standard speech-to-text but takes it one step further by converting those text queries into Python code with proper syntax. So, the simple query "print open quote hello world quote close" will output print("hello world").
